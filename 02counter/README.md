# Counter

This is a simple counter application built with React and Vite, demonstrating the use of the `useState` hook to manage state across multiple counters. You can increase and decrease the values of three independent counters (Counter A, B, and C), with a value range between 0 and 100.

## Features

- **Multiple Counters**: Manage the state of Counter A, B, and C individually.
- **Increase/Decrease Functionality**: Easily increase or decrease the counter values using buttons.
- **Value Range**: Each counter value is restricted to the range of 0 to 100.
